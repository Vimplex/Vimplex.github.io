I am a python developer with some skills in c++ and javascript, and am mainly interested in end-user application development.
Further, I do have the basic HTML and css skills and somewhen used some php as well. 

However, in my opinion programming languages are not what makes you a programmer, but the understanding of general code structures and the will to understand and learn. 

I love to learn new skills, but even more I love the idea of a collaborative production. We should do what we are good in, thats where we will be the most productive.
